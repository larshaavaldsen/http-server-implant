  "description": "This is a basic project, for a simple web server that triggers a webhook when it is reached. The purpose is to act similar to a CanaryToken, where this server sits in an environment and ale rts when it is reached, indicating potential unauthorized users on the network. I built this application to learn how docker works, and also because I wanted a simple implant like this, that does not require the client to hit another URL for the alert to be triggered (i.e. embedding a CanaryToken webhook into a webpage with \"<img src='canary token'>\").",
